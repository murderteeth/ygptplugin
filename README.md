sup! if you have developer access to OpenAI, you can now
install yGptPlugin as an Unverified Plugin from the
plugin store. when prompted, use this domain:

## dev
for now.. to run this project locally you either need to be a memeber of murderteeth's vercel team or you can create your own vercel project and link to that. If you create your own vercel project, use the vercel dashboard to add a postgres database to your project. The following works in either case:
```bash
yarn add vercel -g
vercel link
yarn
yarn pullenv
yarn migrate
yarn dev
```

## db changes and migrations
```bash
# make changes to prisma/schema.prisma
yarn migrate
```

## local plugin testing
- start your local server, `yarn dev`
- go to ChatGPT's plugin store, click `Develop your own plugin`, enter `localhost:3000`.


## manual endpoint testing 
```bash
curl -v \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  'http://localhost:3000/api/ai/sql?languageQuery=vaults%20with%20high%20apy'
```

## sync
```bash
curl -v \
  -H "key: ********" \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{ }' \
  'http://localhost:3000/api/sync'
```

## cron
